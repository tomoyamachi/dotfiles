Inspired by [Sublime SFTP](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp).\n\n[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dingjie/atom-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dingjie/atom-sync)\n\n> This package is currently in early development and has only been tested on Mac. Please kindly [try it out](http://atom.io/packages/atom-sync) and [provide feedback](https://github.com/dingjie/atom-sync/issues/new).\n\n![atom-sync](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/586262/8085519/2b63a7c4-0fc3-11e5-930a-685b09fe7af3.gif)\n\n### Feature ###\n* Sync over ssh+rsync — still [secure](http://www.sakana.fr/blog/2008/05/07/securing-automated-rsync-over-ssh/), but much [faster](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20244585/what-is-the-difference-between-scp-and-rsync).\n* [Multi-Folder Projects](http://blog.atom.io/2015/04/15/multi-folder-projects.html) with different sync config files supported\n\n### Prerequisite ###\n* Ensure you have `ssh` and `rsync` installed.\n\n### Quick Start ###\n* Open a project folder to sync in [Atom](http://atom.io).\n* Right click on the project folder and select `Sync` -> `Edit Remote Config`.\n* Edit and save the config file.\n* Right click on the project folder and select `Sync` -> `Sync Remote -> Local`.\n* Watch water flows.\n\n### Notice ###\n* Password based login is not supported—at least yet, you have to [assign your key file](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh) and better host name in .ssh/config in advanced. Try to [Simplify Your Life With an SSH Config File](http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/).\n\n### Config File ###\n> .sync-config.cson\n\n```\nremote:\n    host: \"HOSTNAME\",       # server name or ip or ssh host abbr in .ssh/config\n    user: \"USERNAME\",       # ssh username\n    path: \"REMOTE_DIR\"      # e.g. /home/someone/somewhere\n\nbehaviour:\n    uploadOnSave: true      # Upload every time you save a file\n    syncDownOnOpen: true    # Download every time you open a file\n    forgetConsole: false    # Never show console panel even while syncing\n    autoHideConsole: true   # Hide console automatically after 1.5s\n    alwaysSyncAll: false    # Sync all files and folders under the project \\\n                            # instead of syncing single file or folder\noption:\n    deleteFiles: true       # Delete files during syncing\n    exclude: [              # Excluding patterns\n        '.sync-config.cson'\n        '.git'\n        'node_modules'\n        'tmp'\n        'vendor'\n    ]\n```\n\n### Keybindings ###\n* `ctrl`+`alt`+`l` Toggle log window\n\n### Known Problems ###\n* You have to `Sync Local -> Remote` manually after renaming and deleteing files.\n\n### Roadmap ###\n* Refactoring\n* ConsoleView::clean() and btnClean\n* --list-only and confirm dialogue\n* Listen to events\n  * Create folders\n  * Rename files/folders\n  * What about deleting?\n* SSH parameters in config file e.g. public key, port et al.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dingjie/atom-sync/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/dingjie/atom-sync#readme","_id":"atom-sync@0.6.0","_shasum":"d3ab5e450d348102841b89793c18835e980f814c","_resolved":"file:../d-116314-1104-1br6iae/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116314-1104-1br6iae/package.tgz"}
