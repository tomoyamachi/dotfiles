Many people are not familiar with Markdown and they will now receive a well-formatted PDF from their developers. **Important here is that the document looks good and professional**. This [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-themeable-pdf) tries to ask about this task.\n\n> If you find this module **useful**, you find **errors**, or you have **suggestions** - please send me your [FEEDBACK](https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/issues/new) - feel free to **CONTRIBUTE**. Keep in mind that this plugin is under active development. :)\n\n### Installation\n\nSearch in atom under **Settings View -> Install -> Packages** the package `markdown-themeable-pdf` and start the installation.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe PDF can be generated in various ways:\n\n-\tRight-click in the editor area when a file is opened and select `Markdown to PDF` **or**\n-\tRight-click on a markdown file in Tree-View and select `Markdown to PDF` **or**\n-\tPress `ctrl-shift-E` (E = Export) in the editor area when a file is opened\n\n#### Page breaks\n\nYou can start any time a new PDF page with typing Snippet/Shortcode `page-break` in your markdown editor. So you can prevent such ugly breaks in lists or other contiguous areas.\n\n#### Custom CSS\n\nThe package creates a CSS file `~/.atom/markdown-themeable-pdf/styles.css` in your atom configuration directory. You can use this file to customize everything. If you want to change the path, you can change it in the package settings. Alternatively, you can define with `project-path/markdown-themeable-pdf/styles.css` for each project its own CSS.\n\n> Tip: Export your markdown as HTML to inspect it in your favorite browser. After CSS changes you must not restart atom.\n\n#### Custom header & Custom footer\n\nThe pdf document can be decorated with your own header and footer. This can be flexibly adapted to JavaScript files. Each of these files represents a node.js module, which returns an object with two required properties `height` and `contents`. After you have made any changes you need to reload or restart atom.\n\nTo customize the document header, open `~/.atom/markdown-themeable-pdf/header.js` (*you can change this path in the package settings*) and change it to your needs:\n\n```javascript\n// EXAMPLE\nmodule.exports = function () {\n    return {\n        height: '2cm',\n        contents: '<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span>Created by</span> <img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Logo\" /> <span style=\"color: #EC4634; font-size: 120%; text-transform: uppercase;\">markdown-themeable-pdf</span></div>'\n    };\n};\n```\n\nTo customize the document footer, open `~/.atom/markdown-themeable-pdf/footer.js` (*you can change this path in the package settings*) and change it to your needs:\n\n```javascript\n// EXAMPLE\nmodule.exports = function () {\n    var dateFormat = function () {\n        return (new Date()).toLocaleDateString('en-US', {\n            weekday: 'long',\n            year: 'numeric',\n            month: 'short',\n            day: 'numeric',\n            hour: '2-digit',\n            minute: '2-digit'\n        });\n    };\n    return {\n        height: '1cm',\n        contents: '<div style=\"float:left;\">Page {{page}}/{{pages}}</div><div style=\"float:right;\">&copy; Copyright ' + dateFormat() + ' by COMPANYNAME</div>'\n    };\n};\n```\n\n> Tip: Alternatively, you can define with `project-path/markdown-themeable-pdf/header.js` or `project-path/markdown-themeable-pdf/footer.js` for each project its own header and footer.\n\n### Example / Demo\n\nSee [Demo.pdf](https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/raw/master/tests/Demo.pdf) - the PDF version of [Demo.md](https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/raw/master/tests/Demo.md).\n\n![DEMO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/master/DEMO.gif)\n\n### Todo\n\n-\tFix: Open Markdown Preview with `ctrl-shift-M`, right-click in markdown-preview area and select `Save As PDF`\n-\tBetter handling of long code lines\n-\tFont Awesome integration\n-\tEmojis\n-\tInline Links (Anchors)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n-\t**Table header glitches when a table starts directly on a new page**\n\n\tWhen that happens, you can put in your markdown in front of the table an html code `<div class=\"page-break\" />` to prevent this.\n\n### Credits\n\nSpecial thanks to ...\n\n-\t[Atom](https://atom.io/) for this wonderful editor!\n-\t[markdown-it/markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) - Markdown parser, done right.\n-\t[marcbachmann/node-html-pdf](https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf) - Html to pdf converter in nodejs.\n-\t[isagalaev/highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js) - Javascript syntax highlighter.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/cakebake/markdown-themeable-pdf#readme","_id":"markdown-themeable-pdf@1.2.0","_shasum":"7ef90bead8e514ce38d71182c98a5cbd26b7e4d3","_resolved":"file:../d-116713-96584-1ay4fbp/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116713-96584-1ay4fbp/package.tgz"}
